Welcome to the coding sheet! This form has a nested structure that follows the presumed structure of an article: An __article__ can contain one or several __studies__, each study can contain one or several __hypotheses__, and each hypothesis can be tested with one or several analyses, meaning that there can be one or several __results__ that relate to each hypothesis. How the form works:

* __Page 1__ (this one): general information about the article
* __Page 2__ (*study* page): specify the first study to be coded in this article
* __Page 3__ (*hypothesis* page): specify the first hypothesis to be coded in this study
* __Page 4__ (*results* page): fill in information about the first result relating to this hypothesis
* If there is another result for this hypothesis, you will loop back and repeat the *results* page
* __Page 5__ (*conclusions* page): when all results for one hypothesis have been coded, code the conclusions for the hypothesis
* If there is another hypothesis to code for this study, you will loop back to the *hypothesis* page
* When all hypotheses for one study have been coded and there is another study to code for this article, you will loop back to the *study* page
* __Page 6__ (final page): When all studies of the article have been coded, fill in a few more general details about the article

We will only code __preregistered__ studies (assuming that an article can contain preregistered and non-preregistered studies, e.g. a pilot study) and __confirmatory__ hypotheses (exploratory hypotheses/analyses are counted, but not coded in detail). 

__*IMPORTANT:*__ Specific responses to some questions will lead to follow-up questions popping up. First: sometimes the follow-up is initially displayed and then disappears when it's not needed - a harmless bug I didn't know how to fix. A more severe bug is when there are follow-up questions to a specific response to a follow-up question to a specific response to a regular question. __If you change your mind too often on the first question, it can lead to some of the pop-up questions malfunctioning/disappearing. Please just try to not click around too much and give precise responses the first time around.__

Please keep notes of any bugs you observe, as well as badly phrased questions, missing answer options, etc. We can fix the form very quickly if needed.

Welcome to the coding sheet! This form has a nested structure that follows the presumed structure of an article: An __article__ can contain one or several __studies__, each study can contain one or several __hypotheses__, and each hypothesis can be tested with one or several analyses, meaning that there can be one or several __results__ that relate to each hypothesis. How the form works:

* __Page 1__ (this one): general information about the article
* __Page 2__ (*study* page): specify the first study to be coded in this article
* __Page 3__ (*hypothesis* page): specify the first hypothesis to be coded in this study
* __Page 4__ (*results* page): fill in information about the first result relating to this hypothesis
* If there is another result for this hypothesis, you will loop back and repeat the *results* page
* __Page 5__ (*conclusions* page): when all results for one hypothesis have been coded, code the conclusions for the hypothesis
* If there is another hypothesis to code for this study, you will loop back to the *hypothesis* page
* When all hypotheses for one study have been coded and there is another study to code for this article, you will loop back to the *study* page
* __Page 6__ (final page): When all studies of the article have been coded, fill in a few more general details about the article

We will only code __preregistered__ studies (assuming that an article can contain preregistered and non-preregistered studies, e.g. a pilot study) and __confirmatory__ hypotheses (exploratory hypotheses/analyses are counted, but not coded in detail). 

__*IMPORTANT:*__ Specific responses to some questions will lead to follow-up questions popping up. First: sometimes the follow-up is initially displayed and then disappears when it's not needed - a harmless bug I didn't know how to fix. A more severe bug is when there are follow-up questions to a specific response to a follow-up question to a specific response to a regular question. __If you change your mind too often on the first question, it can lead to some of the pop-up questions malfunctioning/disappearing. Please just try to not click around too much and give precise responses the first time around.__

Please keep notes of any bugs you observe, as well as badly phrased questions, missing answer options, etc. We can fix the form very quickly if needed.

Welcome to the coding sheet! This form has a nested structure that follows the presumed structure of an article: An __article__ can contain one or several __studies__, each study can contain one or several __hypotheses__, and each hypothesis can be tested with one or several analyses, meaning that there can be one or several __results__ that relate to each hypothesis. How the form works:

* __Page 1__ (this one): general information about the article
* __Page 2__ (*study* page): specify the first study to be coded in this article
* __Page 3__ (*hypothesis* page): specify the first hypothesis to be coded in this study
* __Page 4__ (*results* page): fill in information about the first result relating to this hypothesis
* If there is another result for this hypothesis, you will loop back and repeat the *results* page
* __Page 5__ (*conclusions* page): when all results for one hypothesis have been coded, code the conclusions for the hypothesis
* If there is another hypothesis to code for this study, you will loop back to the *hypothesis* page
* When all hypotheses for one study have been coded and there is another study to code for this article, you will loop back to the *study* page
* __Page 6__ (final page): When all studies of the article have been coded, fill in a few more general details about the article

We will only code __preregistered__ studies (assuming that an article can contain preregistered and non-preregistered studies, e.g. a pilot study) and __confirmatory__ hypotheses (exploratory hypotheses/analyses are counted, but not coded in detail). 

__*IMPORTANT:*__ Specific responses to some questions will lead to follow-up questions popping up. First: sometimes the follow-up is initially displayed and then disappears when it's not needed - a harmless bug I didn't know how to fix. A more severe bug is when there are follow-up questions to a specific response to a follow-up question to a specific response to a regular question. __If you change your mind too often on the first question, it can lead to some of the pop-up questions malfunctioning/disappearing. Please just try to not click around too much and give precise responses the first time around.__

Please keep notes of any bugs you observe, as well as badly phrased questions, missing answer options, etc. We can fix the form very quickly if needed.

Please just try to not click around too much and give precise responses the first time around.__

Please keep notes of any bugs you observe, as well as badly phrased questions, missing answer options, etc. We can fix the form very quickly if needed.

Welcome to the coding sheet! This form has a nested structure that follows the presumed structure of an article: An __article__ can contain one or several __studies__, each study can contain one or several __hypotheses__, and each hypothesis can be tested with one or several analyses, meaning that there can be one or several __results__ that relate to each hypothesis. How the form works:

* __Page 1__ (this one): general information about the article
* __Page 2__ (*study* page): specify the first study to be coded in this article
* __Page 3__ (*hypothesis* page): specify the first hypothesis to be coded in this study
* __Page 4__ (*results* page): fill in information about the first result relating to this hypothesis
* If there is another result for this hypothesis, you will loop back and repeat the *results* page
* __Page 5__ (*conclusions* page): when all results for one hypothesis have been coded, code the conclusions for the hypothesis
* If there is another hypothesis to code for this study, you will loop back to the *hypothesis* page
* When all hypotheses for one study have been coded and there is another study to code for this article, you will loop back to the *study* page
* __Page 6__ (final page): When all studies of the article have been coded, fill in a few more general details about the article

We will only code __preregistered__ studies (assuming that an article can contain preregistered and non-preregistered studies, e.g. a pilot study) and __confirmatory__ hypotheses (exploratory hypotheses/analyses are counted, but not coded in detail). 

__*IMPORTANT:*__ Specific responses to some questions will lead to follow-up questions popping up. First: sometimes the follow-up is initially displayed and then disappears when it's not needed - a harmless bug I didn't know how to fix. A more severe bug is when there are follow-up questions to a specific response to a follow-up question to a specific response to a regular question. __If you change your mind too often on the first question, it can lead to some of the pop-up questions malfunctioning/disappearing. Please just try to not click around too much and give precise responses the first time around.__

Please keep notes of any bugs you observe, as well as badly phrased questions, missing answer options, etc. We can fix the form very quickly if needed.

Welcome to the coding sheet! This form has a nested structure that follows the presumed structure of an article: An __article__ can contain one or several __studies__, each study can contain one or several __hypotheses__, and each hypothesis can be tested with one or several analyses, meaning that there can be one or several __results__ that relate to each hypothesis. How the form works:

* __Page 1__ (this one): general information about the article
* __Page 2__ (*study* page): specify the first study to be coded in this article
* __Page 3__ (*hypothesis* page): specify the first hypothesis to be coded in this study
* __Page 4__ (*results* page): fill in information about the first result relating to this hypothesis
* If there is another result for this hypothesis, you will loop back and repeat the *results* page
* __Page 5__ (*conclusions* page): when all results for one hypothesis have been coded, code the conclusions for the hypothesis
* If there is another hypothesis to code for this study, you will loop back to the *hypothesis* page
* When all hypotheses for one study have been coded and there is another study to code for this article, you will loop back to the *study* page
* __Page 6__ (final page): When all studies of the article have been coded, fill in a few more general details about the article

We will only code __preregistered__ studies (assuming that an article can contain preregistered and non-preregistered studies, e.g. a pilot study) and __confirmatory__ hypotheses (exploratory hypotheses/analyses are counted, but not coded in detail). 

__*IMPORTANT:*__ Specific responses to some questions will lead to follow-up questions popping up. First: sometimes the follow-up is initially displayed and then disappears when it's not needed - a harmless bug I didn't know how to fix. A more severe bug is when there are follow-up questions to a specific response to a follow-up question to a specific response to a regular question. __If you change your mind too often on the first question, it can lead to some of the pop-up questions malfunctioning/disappearing. Please just try to not click around too much and give precise responses the first time around.__

Please keep notes of any bugs you observe, as well as badly phrased questions, missing answer options, etc. We can fix the form very quickly if needed.

Welcome to the coding sheet! This form has a nested structure that follows the presumed structure of an article: An __article__ can contain one or several __studies__, each study can contain one or several __hypotheses__, and each hypothesis can be tested with one or several analyses, meaning that there can be one or several __results__ that relate to each hypothesis. How the form works:

* __Page 1__ (this one): general information about the article
* __Page 2__ (*study* page): specify the first study to be coded in this article
* __Page 3__ (*hypothesis* page): specify the first hypothesis to be coded in this study
* __Page 4__ (*results* page): fill in information about the first result relating to this hypothesis
* If there is another result for this hypothesis, you will loop back and repeat the *results* page
* __Page 5__ (*conclusions* page): when all results for one hypothesis have been coded, code the conclusions for the hypothesis
* If there is another hypothesis to code for this study, you will loop back to the *hypothesis* page
* When all hypotheses for one study have been coded and there is another study to code for this article, you will loop back to the *study* page
* __Page 6__ (final page): When all studies of the article have been coded, fill in a few more general details about the article

We will only code __preregistered__ studies (assuming that an article can contain preregistered and non-preregistered studies, e.g. a pilot study) and __confirmatory__ hypotheses (exploratory hypotheses/analyses are counted, but not coded in detail). 

__*IMPORTANT:*__ Specific responses to some questions will lead to follow-up questions popping up. First: sometimes the follow-up is initially displayed and then disappears when it's not needed - a harmless bug I didn't know how to fix. A more severe bug is when there are follow-up questions to a specific response to a follow-up question to a specific response to a regular question. __If you change your mind too often on the first question, it can lead to some of the pop-up questions malfunctioning/disappearing. Please just try to not click around too much and give precise responses the first time around.__

Please keep notes of any bugs you observe, as well as badly phrased questions, missing answer options, etc. We can fix the form very quickly if needed.

Welcome to the coding sheet! This form has a nested structure that follows the presumed structure of an article: An __article__ can contain one or several __studies__, each study can contain one or several __hypotheses__, and each hypothesis can be tested with one or several analyses, meaning that there can be one or several __results__ that relate to each hypothesis.

__*IMPORTANT:*__ Specific responses to some questions will lead to follow-up questions popping up. First: sometimes the follow-up is initially displayed and then disappears when it's not needed - a harmless bug I didn't know how to fix.

Welcome to the coding sheet! This form has a nested structure that follows the presumed structure of an article: An __article__ can contain one or several __studies__, each study can contain one or several __hypotheses__, and each hypothesis can be tested with one or several analyses, meaning that there can be one or several __results__ that relate to each hypothesis. How the form works:

* __Page 1__ (this one): general information about the article
* __Page 2__ (*study* page): specify the first study to be coded in this article
* __Page 3__ (*hypothesis* page): specify the first hypothesis to be coded in this study
* __Page 4__ (*results* page): fill in information about the first result relating to this hypothesis
* If there is another result for this hypothesis, you will loop back and repeat the *results* page
* __Page 5__ (*conclusions* page): when all results for one hypothesis have been coded, code the conclusions for the hypothesis
* If there is another hypothesis to code for this study, you will loop back to the *hypothesis* page
* When all hypotheses for one study have been coded and there is another study to code for this article, you will loop back to the *study* page
* __Page 6__ (final page): When all studies of the article have been coded, fill in a few more general details about the article

We will only code __preregistered__ studies (assuming that an article can contain preregistered and non-preregistered studies, e.g. a pilot study) and __confirmatory__ hypotheses (exploratory hypotheses/analyses are counted, but not coded in detail). 

__*IMPORTANT:*__ Specific responses to some questions will lead to follow-up questions popping up. First: sometimes the follow-up is initially displayed and then disappears when it's not needed - a harmless bug I didn't know how to fix. A more severe bug is when there are follow-up questions to a specific response to a follow-up question to a specific response to a regular question. __If you change your mind too often on the first question, it can lead to some of the pop-up questions malfunctioning/disappearing. Please just try to not click around too much and give precise responses the first time around.__

Please keep notes of any bugs you observe, as well as badly phrased questions, missing answer options, etc. We can fix the form very quickly if needed.

Welcome to the coding sheet! This form has a nested structure that follows the presumed structure of an article: An __article__ can contain one or several __studies__, each study can contain one or several __hypotheses__, and each hypothesis can be tested with one or several analyses, meaning that there can be one or several __results__ that relate to each hypothesis. How the form works:

* __Page 1__ (this one): general information about the article
* __Page 2__ (*study* page): specify the first study to be coded in this article
* __Page 3__ (*hypothesis* page): specify the first hypothesis to be coded in this study
* __Page 4__ (*results* page): fill in information about the first result relating to this hypothesis
* If there is another result for this hypothesis, you will loop back and repeat the *results* page
* __Page 5__ (*conclusions* page): when all results for one hypothesis have been coded, code the conclusions for the hypothesis
* If there is another hypothesis to code for this study, you will loop back to the *hypothesis* page
* When all hypotheses for one study have been coded and there is another study to code for this article, you will loop back to the *study* page
* __Page 6__ (final page): When all studies of the article have been coded, fill in a few more general details about the article

We will only code __preregistered__ studies (assuming that an article can contain preregistered and non-preregistered studies, e.g. a pilot study) and __confirmatory__ hypotheses (exploratory hypotheses/analyses are counted, but not coded in detail). 

__*IMPORTANT:*__ Specific responses to some questions will lead to follow-up questions popping up. First: sometimes the follow-up is initially displayed and then disappears when it's not needed - a harmless bug I didn't know how to fix. A more severe bug is when there are follow-up questions to a specific response to a follow-up question to a specific response to a regular question. __If you change your mind too often on the first question, it can lead to some of the pop-up questions malfunctioning/disappearing. Please just try to not click around too much and give precise responses the first time around.__

Please keep notes of any bugs you observe, as well as badly phrased questions, missing answer options, etc. We can fix the form very quickly if needed.

To confirm this, we conducted a pre-registered replication of Study 2 via the Open Science Framework (https://osf.io/zjevk/) for two reasons. First, we acknowledge the need for increased reproducibility in psychology research (Open Science Collaboration, 2015). This may be especially important when existing evidence relies on p-values very near the cri-terion for significance (Simonsohn, Nelson, & Simmons, 2014), as in ourStudy 2. Second, we wanted to improve the methodology of Study 2 by doubling the number of target faces seen by each participant (see Westfall, Judd, & Kenny, 2015, for a convincing argument advocatingthe need to increase stimulus sample size) and by cropping all of the faces to (a) exclude the neck and shoulders, and (b) eliminate excess hair. The latter ensured that participants inferred trustworthiness and dominance based on thefacesversus extrafacial features.","2018-08-07 09:16:13","325118.6999999918","1","11","0"

Welcome to the coding sheet! This form has a nested structure that follows the presumed structure of an article: An __article__ can contain one or several __studies__, each study can contain one or several __hypotheses__, and each hypothesis can be tested with one or several analyses, meaning that there can be one or several __results__ that relate to each hypothesis. How the form works:

* __Page 1__ (this one): general information about the article
* __Page 2__ (*study* page): specify the first study to be coded in this article
* __Page 3__ (*hypothesis* page): specify the first hypothesis to be coded in this study
* __Page 4__ (*results* page): fill in information about the first result relating to this hypothesis
* If there is another result for this hypothesis, you will loop back and repeat the *results* page
* __Page 5__ (*conclusions* page): when all results for one hypothesis have been coded, code the conclusions for the hypothesis
* If there is another hypothesis to code for this study, you will loop back to the *hypothesis* page
* When all hypotheses for one study have been coded and there is another study to code for this article, you will loop back to the *study* page
* __Page 6__ (final page): When all studies of the article have been coded, fill in a few more general details about the article

We will only code __preregistered__ studies (assuming that an article can contain preregistered and non-preregistered studies, e.g. a pilot study) and __confirmatory__ hypotheses (exploratory hypotheses/analyses are counted, but not coded in detail). 

__*IMPORTANT:*__ Specific responses to some questions will lead to follow-up questions popping up. First: sometimes the follow-up is initially displayed and then disappears when it's not needed - a harmless bug I didn't know how to fix. A more severe bug is when there are follow-up questions to a specific response to a follow-up question to a specific response to a regular question. __If you change your mind too often on the first question, it can lead to some of the pop-up questions malfunctioning/disappearing. Please just try to not click around too much and give precise responses the first time around.__

Please keep notes of any bugs you observe, as well as badly phrased questions, missing answer options, etc. We can fix the form very quickly if needed.

Welcome to the coding sheet! This form has a nested structure that follows the presumed structure of an article: An __article__ can contain one or several __studies__, each study can contain one or several __hypotheses__, and each hypothesis can be tested with one or several analyses, meaning that there can be one or several __results__ that relate to each hypothesis. How the form works:

* __Page 1__ (this one): general information about the article
* __Page 2__ (*study* page): specify the first study to be coded in this article
* __Page 3__ (*hypothesis* page): specify the first hypothesis to be coded in this study
* __Page 4__ (*results* page): fill in information about the first result relating to this hypothesis
* If there is another result for this hypothesis, you will loop back and repeat the *results* page
* __Page 5__ (*conclusions* page): when all results for one hypothesis have been coded, code the conclusions for the hypothesis
* If there is another hypothesis to code for this study, you will loop back to the *hypothesis* page
* When all hypotheses for one study have been coded and there is another study to code for this article, you will loop back to the *study* page
* __Page 6__ (final page): When all studies of the article have been coded, fill in a few more general details about the article

We will only code __preregistered__ studies (assuming that an article can contain preregistered and non-preregistered studies, e.g. a pilot study) and __confirmatory__ hypotheses (exploratory hypotheses/analyses are counted, but not coded in detail). 

__*IMPORTANT:*__ Specific responses to some questions will lead to follow-up questions popping up. First: sometimes the follow-up is initially displayed and then disappears when it's not needed - a harmless bug I didn't know how to fix. A more severe bug is when there are follow-up questions to a specific response to a follow-up question to a specific response to a regular question. __If you change your mind too often on the first question, it can lead to some of the pop-up questions malfunctioning/disappearing. Please just try to not click around too much and give precise responses the first time around.__

Please keep notes of any bugs you observe, as well as badly phrased questions, missing answer options, etc. We can fix the form very quickly if needed.

Welcome to the coding sheet! This form has a nested structure that follows the presumed structure of an article: An __article__ can contain one or several __studies__, each study can contain one or several __hypotheses__, and each hypothesis can be tested with one or several analyses, meaning that there can be one or several __results__ that relate to each hypothesis. How the form works:

* __Page 1__ (this one): general information about the article
* __Page 2__ (*study* page): specify the first study to be coded in this article
* __Page 3__ (*hypothesis* page): specify the first hypothesis to be coded in this study
* __Page 4__ (*results* page): fill in information about the first result relating to this hypothesis
* If there is another result for this hypothesis, you will loop back and repeat the *results* page
* __Page 5__ (*conclusions* page): when all results for one hypothesis have been coded, code the conclusions for the hypothesis
* If there is another hypothesis to code for this study, you will loop back to the *hypothesis* page
* When all hypotheses for one study have been coded and there is another study to code for this article, you will loop back to the *study* page
* __Page 6__ (final page): When all studies of the article have been coded, fill in a few more general details about the article

We will only code __preregistered__ studies (assuming that an article can contain preregistered and non-preregistered studies, e.g. a pilot study) and __confirmatory__ hypotheses (exploratory hypotheses/analyses are counted, but not coded in detail). 

__*IMPORTANT:*__ Specific responses to some questions will lead to follow-up questions popping up. First: sometimes the follow-up is initially displayed and then disappears when it's not needed - a harmless bug I didn't know how to fix. A more severe bug is when there are follow-up questions to a specific response to a follow-up question to a specific response to a regular question. __If you change your mind too often on the first question, it can lead to some of the pop-up questions malfunctioning/disappearing. Please just try to not click around too much and give precise responses the first time around.__

Please keep notes of any bugs you observe, as well as badly phrased questions, missing answer options, etc. We can fix the form very quickly if needed.

Welcome to the coding sheet! This form has a nested structure that follows the presumed structure of an article: An __article__ can contain one or several __studies__, each study can contain one or several __hypotheses__, and each hypothesis can be tested with one or several analyses, meaning that there can be one or several __results__ that relate to each hypothesis. How the form works:

* __Page 1__ (this one): general information about the article
* __Page 2__ (*study* page): specify the first study to be coded in this article
* __Page 3__ (*hypothesis* page): specify the first hypothesis to be coded in this study
* __Page 4__ (*results* page): fill in information about the first result relating to this hypothesis
* If there is another result for this hypothesis, you will loop back and repeat the *results* page
* __Page 5__ (*conclusions* page): when all results for one hypothesis have been coded, code the conclusions for the hypothesis
* If there is another hypothesis to code for this study, you will loop back to the *hypothesis* page
* When all hypotheses for one study have been coded and there is another study to code for this article, you will loop back to the *study* page
* __Page 6__ (final page): When all studies of the article have been coded, fill in a few more general details about the article

We will only code __preregistered__ studies (assuming that an article can contain preregistered and non-preregistered studies, e.g. a pilot study) and __confirmatory__ hypotheses (exploratory hypotheses/analyses are counted, but not coded in detail). 

__*IMPORTANT:*__ Specific responses to some questions will lead to follow-up questions popping up. First: sometimes the follow-up is initially displayed and then disappears when it's not needed - a harmless bug I didn't know how to fix. A more severe bug is when there are follow-up questions to a specific response to a follow-up question to a specific response to a regular question. __If you change your mind too often on the first question, it can lead to some of the pop-up questions malfunctioning/disappearing. Please just try to not click around too much and give precise responses the first time around.__

Please keep notes of any bugs you observe, as well as badly phrased questions, missing answer options, etc. We can fix the form very quickly if needed.

For individual points, adding MSCEIT scores yielded a significant partner effect of employees’ MSCEIT on recruiters’ points (Beta = 0.23, p < .05). This path was already marginally significant in the MSCEIT only model (Beta = 0.32, p < .06; see Table 4 ), suggesting that the effects of the MSCEIT and GERT are independent and complementary, rather than incremental: Recruiters’ gains were predicted by employees’ MSCEIT scores, whereas employees’ gains were predicted by recruiters’ GERT scores. Adding NV5-R scores to the model did not yield any significant paths.","2018-08-08 12:02:23","37087.70000003278","1","2","0"

Welcome to the coding sheet! This form has a nested structure that follows the presumed structure of an article: An __article__ can contain one or several __studies__, each study can contain one or several __hypotheses__, and each hypothesis can be tested with one or several analyses, meaning that there can be one or several __results__ that relate to each hypothesis. How the form works:

* __Page 1__ (this one): general information about the article
* __Page 2__ (*study* page): specify the first study to be coded in this article
* __Page 3__ (*hypothesis* page): specify the first hypothesis to be coded in this study
* __Page 4__ (*results* page): fill in information about the first result relating to this hypothesis
* If there is another result for this hypothesis, you will loop back and repeat the *results* page
* __Page 5__ (*conclusions* page): when all results for one hypothesis have been coded, code the conclusions for the hypothesis
* If there is another hypothesis to code for this study, you will loop back to the *hypothesis* page
* When all hypotheses for one study have been coded and there is another study to code for this article, you will loop back to the *study* page
* __Page 6__ (final page): When all studies of the article have been coded, fill in a few more general details about the article

We will only code __preregistered__ studies (assuming that an article can contain preregistered and non-preregistered studies, e.g. a pilot study) and __confirmatory__ hypotheses (exploratory hypotheses/analyses are counted, but not coded in detail). 

__*IMPORTANT:*__ Specific responses to some questions will lead to follow-up questions popping up. First: sometimes the follow-up is initially displayed and then disappears when it's not needed - a harmless bug I didn't know how to fix. A more severe bug is when there are follow-up questions to a specific response to a follow-up question to a specific response to a regular question. __If you change your mind too often on the first question, it can lead to some of the pop-up questions malfunctioning/disappearing. Please just try to not click around too much and give precise responses the first time around.__

Please keep notes of any bugs you observe, as well as badly phrased questions, missing answer options, etc. We can fix the form very quickly if needed.

Welcome to the coding sheet! This form has a nested structure that follows the presumed structure of an article: An __article__ can contain one or several __studies__, each study can contain one or several __hypotheses__, and each hypothesis can be tested with one or several analyses, meaning that there can be one or several __results__ that relate to each hypothesis. How the form works:

* __Page 1__ (this one): general information about the article
* __Page 2__ (*study* page): specify the first study to be coded in this article
* __Page 3__ (*hypothesis* page): specify the first hypothesis to be coded in this study
* __Page 4__ (*results* page): fill in information about the first result relating to this hypothesis
* If there is another result for this hypothesis, you will loop back and repeat the *results* page
* __Page 5__ (*conclusions* page): when all results for one hypothesis have been coded, code the conclusions for the hypothesis
* If there is another hypothesis to code for this study, you will loop back to the *hypothesis* page
* When all hypotheses for one study have been coded and there is another study to code for this article, you will loop back to the *study* page
* __Page 6__ (final page): When all studies of the article have been coded, fill in a few more general details about the article

We will only code __preregistered__ studies (assuming that an article can contain preregistered and non-preregistered studies, e.g. a pilot study) and __confirmatory__ hypotheses (exploratory hypotheses/analyses are counted, but not coded in detail). 

__*IMPORTANT:*__ Specific responses to some questions will lead to follow-up questions popping up. First: sometimes the follow-up is initially displayed and then disappears when it's not needed - a harmless bug I didn't know how to fix. A more severe bug is when there are follow-up questions to a specific response to a follow-up question to a specific response to a regular question. __If you change your mind too often on the first question, it can lead to some of the pop-up questions malfunctioning/disappearing. Please just try to not click around too much and give precise responses the first time around.__

Please keep notes of any bugs you observe, as well as badly phrased questions, missing answer options, etc. We can fix the form very quickly if needed.

We will only code __preregistered__ studies (assuming that an article can contain preregistered and non-preregistered studies, e.g. a pilot study) and __confirmatory__ hypotheses (exploratory hypotheses/analyses are counted, but not coded in detail). 

__*IMPORTANT:*__ Specific responses to some questions will lead to follow-up questions popping up. First: sometimes the follow-up is initially displayed and then disappears when it's not needed - a harmless bug I didn't know how to fix. A more severe bug is when there are follow-up questions to a specific response to a follow-up question to a specific response to a regular question. __If you change your mind too often on the first question, it can lead to some of the pop-up questions malfunctioning/disappearing. Please just try to not click around too much and give precise responses the first time around.__

Please keep notes of any bugs you observe, as well as badly phrased questions, missing answer options, etc. We can fix the form very quickly if needed.

Welcome to the coding sheet! This form has a nested structure that follows the presumed structure of an article: An __article__ can contain one or several __studies__, each study can contain one or several __hypotheses__, and each hypothesis can be tested with one or several analyses, meaning that there can be one or several __results__ that relate to each hypothesis. How the form works:

* __Page 1__ (this one): general information about the article
* __Page 2__ (*study* page): specify the first study to be coded in this article
* __Page 3__ (*hypothesis* page): specify the first hypothesis to be coded in this study
* __Page 4__ (*results* page): fill in information about the first result relating to this hypothesis
* If there is another result for this hypothesis, you will loop back and repeat the *results* page
* __Page 5__ (*conclusions* page): when all results for one hypothesis have been coded, code the conclusions for the hypothesis
* If there is another hypothesis to code for this study, you will loop back to the *hypothesis* page
* When all hypotheses for one study have been coded and there is another study to code for this article, you will loop back to the *study* page
* __Page 6__ (final page): When all studies of the article have been coded, fill in a few more general details about the article

We will only code __preregistered__ studies (assuming that an article can contain preregistered and non-preregistered studies, e.g. a pilot study) and __confirmatory__ hypotheses (exploratory hypotheses/analyses are counted, but not coded in detail). 

__*IMPORTANT:*__ Specific responses to some questions will lead to follow-up questions popping up. First: sometimes the follow-up is initially displayed and then disappears when it's not needed - a harmless bug I didn't know how to fix. A more severe bug is when there are follow-up questions to a specific response to a follow-up question to a specific response to a regular question. __If you change your mind too often on the first question, it can lead to some of the pop-up questions malfunctioning/disappearing. Please just try to not click around too much and give precise responses the first time around.__

That means the number of between-s conditions is 2. For some of the analyses, however, the smallest unit is a dyad, not one participant (i.e. in that case, N = 64, number of between-s conditions = 1). Other results, like the current one, concern only employees or only recruiters, which again means N = 64 and number of conditions = 1.","2018-08-09 14:57:58","4793749","1","57","0"

GMA predicted joint and individual economic and relational indicators
of negotiation performance. Overall, the GERT was related
to all four outcome variables, although effects depended on the
negotiator’s role and to some extent, on gender. The total MSCEIT
predicted only individual points. Some MSCEIT branches predicted
other outcomes as well, but results were inconsistent as each
branch predicted only one or two of the four outcomes.

In contrast to previous studies and the theoretical predictions of
Fulmer and Barry (2004), we did not find any relationship between

Welcome to the coding sheet! This form has a nested structure that follows the presumed structure of an article: An __article__ can contain one or several __studies__, each study can contain one or several __hypotheses__, and each hypothesis can be tested with one or several analyses, meaning that there can be one or several __results__ that relate to each hypothesis. How the form works:

* __Page 1__ (this one): general information about the article
* __Page 2__ (*study* page): specify the first study to be coded in this article
* __Page 3__ (*hypothesis* page): specify the first hypothesis to be coded in this study
* __Page 4__ (*results* page): fill in information about the first result relating to this hypothesis
* If there is another result for this hypothesis, you will loop back and repeat the *results* page
* __Page 5__ (*conclusions* page): when all results for one hypothesis have been coded, code the conclusions for the hypothesis
* If there is another hypothesis to code for this study, you will loop back to the *hypothesis* page
* When all hypotheses for one study have been coded and there is another study to code for this article, you will loop back to the *study* page
* __Page 6__ (final page): When all studies of the article have been coded, fill in a few more general details about the article

We will only code __preregistered__ studies (assuming that an article can contain preregistered and non-preregistered studies, e.g. a pilot study) and __confirmatory__ hypotheses (exploratory hypotheses/analyses are counted, but not coded in detail). 

__*IMPORTANT:*__ Specific responses to some questions will lead to follow-up questions popping up. First: sometimes the follow-up is initially displayed and then disappears when it's not needed - a harmless bug I didn't know how to fix. A more severe bug is when there are follow-up questions to a specific response to a follow-up question to a specific response to a regular question. __If you change your mind too often on the first question, it can lead to some of the pop-up questions malfunctioning/disappearing. Please just try to not click around too much and give precise responses the first time around.__

Please keep notes of any bugs you observe, as well as badly phrased questions, missing answer options, etc. We can fix the form very quickly if needed.

attitudes as assessed by the NEP did not predict choices while general attitude strength
did. This dissociation might be because we did not succeed in separating attitude
position and strength. At the same time, holding more positive specific attitudes toward
renewable energy and holding them more strongly did lead to a higher propensity to
choose the green electricity provider. Overall, this partial support of Hypothesis 2 lends
credence to the validity of the scenario as a whole.","2018-08-10 08:31:19","202152","1","1","0"

Welcome to the coding sheet! This form has a nested structure that follows the presumed structure of an article: An __article__ can contain one or several __studies__, each study can contain one or several __hypotheses__, and each hypothesis can be tested with one or several analyses, meaning that there can be one or several __results__ that relate to each hypothesis. How the form works:

* __Page 1__ (this one): general information about the article
* __Page 2__ (*study* page): specify the first study to be coded in this article
* __Page 3__ (*hypothesis* page): specify the first hypothesis to be coded in this study
* __Page 4__ (*results* page): fill in information about the first result relating to this hypothesis
* If there is another result for this hypothesis, you will loop back and repeat the *results* page
* __Page 5__ (*conclusions* page): when all results for one hypothesis have been coded, code the conclusions for the hypothesis
* If there is another hypothesis to code for this study, you will loop back to the *hypothesis* page
* When all hypotheses for one study have been coded and there is another study to code for this article, you will loop back to the *study* page
* __Page 6__ (final page): When all studies of the article have been coded, fill in a few more general details about the article

We will only code __preregistered__ studies (assuming that an article can contain preregistered and non-preregistered studies, e.g. a pilot study) and __confirmatory__ hypotheses (exploratory hypotheses/analyses are counted, but not coded in detail). 

__*IMPORTANT:*__ Specific responses to some questions will lead to follow-up questions popping up. First: sometimes the follow-up is initially displayed and then disappears when it's not needed - a harmless bug I didn't know how to fix. A more severe bug is when there are follow-up questions to a specific response to a follow-up question to a specific response to a regular question. __If you change your mind too often on the first question, it can lead to some of the pop-up questions malfunctioning/disappearing. Please just try to not click around too much and give precise responses the first time around.__

Please keep notes of any bugs you observe, as well as badly phrased questions, missing answer options, etc. We can fix the form very quickly if needed.

Welcome to the coding sheet! This form has a nested structure that follows the presumed structure of an article: An __article__ can contain one or several __studies__, each study can contain one or several __hypotheses__, and each hypothesis can be tested with one or several analyses, meaning that there can be one or several __results__ that relate to each hypothesis. How the form works:

* __Page 1__ (this one): general information about the article
* __Page 2__ (*study* page): specify the first study to be coded in this article
* __Page 3__ (*hypothesis* page): specify the first hypothesis to be coded in this study
* __Page 4__ (*results* page): fill in information about the first result relating to this hypothesis
* If there is another result for this hypothesis, you will loop back and repeat the *results* page
* __Page 5__ (*conclusions* page): when all results for one hypothesis have been coded, code the conclusions for the hypothesis
* If there is another hypothesis to code for this study, you will loop back to the *hypothesis* page
* When all hypotheses for one study have been coded and there is another study to code for this article, you will loop back to the *study* page
* __Page 6__ (final page): When all studies of the article have been coded, fill in a few more general details about the article

We will only code __preregistered__ studies (assuming that an article can contain preregistered and non-preregistered studies, e.g. a pilot study) and __confirmatory__ hypotheses (exploratory hypotheses/analyses are counted, but not coded in detail). 

__*IMPORTANT:*__ Specific responses to some questions will lead to follow-up questions popping up. First: sometimes the follow-up is initially displayed and then disappears when it's not needed - a harmless bug I didn't know how to fix. A more severe bug is when there are follow-up questions to a specific response to a follow-up question to a specific response to a regular question. __If you change your mind too often on the first question, it can lead to some of the pop-up questions malfunctioning/disappearing. Please just try to not click around too much and give precise responses the first time around.__

Please keep notes of any bugs you observe, as well as badly phrased questions, missing answer options, etc. We can fix the form very quickly if needed.

type of memory representation. Relative to familiaritybased
memories, recollection-based memories were
more prone to decay than to interference. Likewise,relative to recollection-based memories, familiarity-based
memories were more prone to interference than to decay.
The pattern was the same for the other analysis: Relative
to low-confidence memories, high-confidence memories
were more prone to decay than to interference, and relative
to high-confidence memories, low-confidence memories
were more prone to interference than to decay. This
pattern of results is all the more telling because, to date,
most experimental manipulations (e.g., levels of processing,
attention) have been found to exert their effects
more strongly on recollection-based memories or
high-confidence memories than on familiarity-based
memories or low-confidence memories (Yonelinas, 2002).
Our results thus provide the first direct and clear evidence

Welcome to the coding sheet! This form has a nested structure that follows the presumed structure of an article: An __article__ can contain one or several __studies__, each study can contain one or several __hypotheses__, and each hypothesis can be tested with one or several analyses, meaning that there can be one or several __results__ that relate to each hypothesis. How the form works:

* __Page 1__ (this one): general information about the article
* __Page 2__ (*study* page): specify the first study to be coded in this article
* __Page 3__ (*hypothesis* page): specify the first hypothesis to be coded in this study
* __Page 4__ (*results* page): fill in information about the first result relating to this hypothesis
* If there is another result for this hypothesis, you will loop back and repeat the *results* page
* __Page 5__ (*conclusions* page): when all results for one hypothesis have been coded, code the conclusions for the hypothesis
* If there is another hypothesis to code for this study, you will loop back to the *hypothesis* page
* When all hypotheses for one study have been coded and there is another study to code for this article, you will loop back to the *study* page
* __Page 6__ (final page): When all studies of the article have been coded, fill in a few more general details about the article

We will only code __preregistered__ studies (assuming that an article can contain preregistered and non-preregistered studies, e.g. a pilot study) and __confirmatory__ hypotheses (exploratory hypotheses/analyses are counted, but not coded in detail). 

__*IMPORTANT:*__ Specific responses to some questions will lead to follow-up questions popping up. First: sometimes the follow-up is initially displayed and then disappears when it's not needed - a harmless bug I didn't know how to fix. A more severe bug is when there are follow-up questions to a specific response to a follow-up question to a specific response to a regular question. __If you change your mind too often on the first question, it can lead to some of the pop-up questions malfunctioning/disappearing. Please just try to not click around too much and give precise responses the first time around.__

Please keep notes of any bugs you observe, as well as badly phrased questions, missing answer options, etc. We can fix the form very quickly if needed.

Welcome to the coding sheet! This form has a nested structure that follows the presumed structure of an article: An __article__ can contain one or several __studies__, each study can contain one or several __hypotheses__, and each hypothesis can be tested with one or several analyses, meaning that there can be one or several __results__ that relate to each hypothesis. How the form works:

* __Page 1__ (this one): general information about the article
* __Page 2__ (*study* page): specify the first study to be coded in this article
* __Page 3__ (*hypothesis* page): specify the first hypothesis to be coded in this study
* __Page 4__ (*results* page): fill in information about the first result relating to this hypothesis
* If there is another result for this hypothesis, you will loop back and repeat the *results* page
* __Page 5__ (*conclusions* page): when all results for one hypothesis have been coded, code the conclusions for the hypothesis
* If there is another hypothesis to code for this study, you will loop back to the *hypothesis* page
* When all hypotheses for one study have been coded and there is another study to code for this article, you will loop back to the *study* page
* __Page 6__ (final page): When all studies of the article have been coded, fill in a few more general details about the article

We will only code __preregistered__ studies (assuming that an article can contain preregistered and non-preregistered studies, e.g. a pilot study) and __confirmatory__ hypotheses (exploratory hypotheses/analyses are counted, but not coded in detail). 

__*IMPORTANT:*__ Specific responses to some questions will lead to follow-up questions popping up. First: sometimes the follow-up is initially displayed and then disappears when it's not needed - a harmless bug I didn't know how to fix. A more severe bug is when there are follow-up questions to a specific response to a follow-up question to a specific response to a regular question. __If you change your mind too often on the first question, it can lead to some of the pop-up questions malfunctioning/disappearing. Please just try to not click around too much and give precise responses the first time around.__

Please keep notes of any bugs you observe, as well as badly phrased questions, missing answer options, etc. We can fix the form very quickly if needed.

Welcome to the coding sheet! This form has a nested structure that follows the presumed structure of an article: An __article__ can contain one or several __studies__, each study can contain one or several __hypotheses__, and each hypothesis can be tested with one or several analyses, meaning that there can be one or several __results__ that relate to each hypothesis. How the form works:

* __Page 1__ (this one): general information about the article
* __Page 2__ (*study* page): specify the first study to be coded in this article
* __Page 3__ (*hypothesis* page): specify the first hypothesis to be coded in this study
* __Page 4__ (*results* page): fill in information about the first result relating to this hypothesis
* If there is another result for this hypothesis, you will loop back and repeat the *results* page
* __Page 5__ (*conclusions* page): when all results for one hypothesis have been coded, code the conclusions for the hypothesis
* If there is another hypothesis to code for this study, you will loop back to the *hypothesis* page
* When all hypotheses for one study have been coded and there is another study to code for this article, you will loop back to the *study* page
* __Page 6__ (final page): When all studies of the article have been coded, fill in a few more general details about the article

We will only code __preregistered__ studies (assuming that an article can contain preregistered and non-preregistered studies, e.g. a pilot study) and __confirmatory__ hypotheses (exploratory hypotheses/analyses are counted, but not coded in detail). 

__*IMPORTANT:*__ Specific responses to some questions will lead to follow-up questions popping up. First: sometimes the follow-up is initially displayed and then disappears when it's not needed - a harmless bug I didn't know how to fix. A more severe bug is when there are follow-up questions to a specific response to a follow-up question to a specific response to a regular question. __If you change your mind too often on the first question, it can lead to some of the pop-up questions malfunctioning/disappearing. Please just try to not click around too much and give precise responses the first time around.__

Please keep notes of any bugs you observe, as well as badly phrased questions, missing answer options, etc. We can fix the form very quickly if needed.

Welcome to the coding sheet! This form has a nested structure that follows the presumed structure of an article: An __article__ can contain one or several __studies__, each study can contain one or several __hypotheses__, and each hypothesis can be tested with one or several analyses, meaning that there can be one or several __results__ that relate to each hypothesis. How the form works:

* __Page 1__ (this one): general information about the article
* __Page 2__ (*study* page): specify the first study to be coded in this article
* __Page 3__ (*hypothesis* page): specify the first hypothesis to be coded in this study
* __Page 4__ (*results* page): fill in information about the first result relating to this hypothesis
* If there is another result for this hypothesis, you will loop back and repeat the *results* page
* __Page 5__ (*conclusions* page): when all results for one hypothesis have been coded, code the conclusions for the hypothesis
* If there is another hypothesis to code for this study, you will loop back to the *hypothesis* page
* When all hypotheses for one study have been coded and there is another study to code for this article, you will loop back to the *study* page
* __Page 6__ (final page): When all studies of the article have been coded, fill in a few more general details about the article

We will only code __preregistered__ studies (assuming that an article can contain preregistered and non-preregistered studies, e.g. a pilot study) and __confirmatory__ hypotheses (exploratory hypotheses/analyses are counted, but not coded in detail). 

__*IMPORTANT:*__ Specific responses to some questions will lead to follow-up questions popping up. First: sometimes the follow-up is initially displayed and then disappears when it's not needed - a harmless bug I didn't know how to fix. A more severe bug is when there are follow-up questions to a specific response to a follow-up question to a specific response to a regular question. __If you change your mind too often on the first question, it can lead to some of the pop-up questions malfunctioning/disappearing. Please just try to not click around too much and give precise responses the first time around.__

Please keep notes of any bugs you observe, as well as badly phrased questions, missing answer options, etc. We can fix the form very quickly if needed.

To confirm this, we conducted a pre-registered replication of Study 2 via the Open Science Framework (https://osf.io/zjevk/) for two reasons. First, we acknowledge the need for increased reproducibility in psychology research (Open Science Collaboration, 2015). This may be especially important when existing evidence relies on p-values very near the criterion for significance (Simonsohn, Nelson, & Simmons, 2014), as in our Study 2. Second, we wanted to improve the methodology of Study 2 by doubling the number of target faces seen by each participant (see Westfall, Judd, & Kenny, 2015, for a convincing argument advocating the need to increase stimulus sample size) and by cropping all of the faces to (a) exclude the neck and shoulders, and (b) eliminate excess hair. The latter ensured that participants inferred trustworthiness and dominance based on the faces versus extrafacial features.","2018-08-20 11:38:27","601162","1","11","0"
