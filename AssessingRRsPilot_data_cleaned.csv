Welcome to the coding sheet! This form has a nested structure that follows the presumed structure of an article: An __article__ can contain one or several __studies__, each study can contain one or several __hypotheses__, and each hypothesis can be tested with one or several analyses, meaning that there can be one or several __results__ that relate to each hypothesis. How the form works:

* __Page 1__ (this one): general information about the article
* __Page 2__ (*study* page): specify the first study to be coded in this article
* __Page 3__ (*hypothesis* page): specify the first hypothesis to be coded in this study
* __Page 4__ (*results* page): fill in information about the first result relating to this hypothesis
* If there is another result for this hypothesis, you will loop back and repeat the *results* page
* __Page 5__ (*conclusions* page): when all results for one hypothesis have been coded, code the conclusions for the hypothesis
* If there is another hypothesis to code for this study, you will loop back to the *hypothesis* page
* When all hypotheses for one study have been coded and there is another study to code for this article, you will loop back to the *study* page
* __Page 6__ (final page): When all studies of the article have been coded, fill in a few more general details about the article

We will only code __preregistered__ studies (assuming that an article can contain preregistered and non-preregistered studies, e.g. a pilot study) and __confirmatory__ hypotheses (exploratory hypotheses/analyses are counted, but not coded in detail). 

__*IMPORTANT:*__ Specific responses to some questions will lead to follow-up questions popping up. First: sometimes the follow-up is initially displayed and then disappears when it's not needed - a harmless bug I didn't know how to fix. A more severe bug is when there are follow-up questions to a specific response to a follow-up question to a specific response to a regular question. __If you change your mind too often on the first question, it can lead to some of the pop-up questions malfunctioning/disappearing. Please just try to not click around too much and give precise responses the first time around.__

Please keep notes of any bugs you observe, as well as badly phrased questions, missing answer options, etc. We can fix the form very quickly if needed.

Welcome to the coding sheet! This form has a nested structure that follows the presumed structure of an article: An __article__ can contain one or several __studies__, each study can contain one or several __hypotheses__, and each hypothesis can be tested with one or several analyses, meaning that there can be one or several __results__ that relate to each hypothesis. How the form works:

* __Page 1__ (this one): general information about the article
* __Page 2__ (*study* page): specify the first study to be coded in this article
* __Page 3__ (*hypothesis* page): specify the first hypothesis to be coded in this study
* __Page 4__ (*results* page): fill in information about the first result relating to this hypothesis
* If there is another result for this hypothesis, you will loop back and repeat the *results* page
* __Page 5__ (*conclusions* page): when all results for one hypothesis have been coded, code the conclusions for the hypothesis
* If there is another hypothesis to code for this study, you will loop back to the *hypothesis* page
* When all hypotheses for one study have been coded and there is another study to code for this article, you will loop back to the *study* page
* __Page 6__ (final page): When all studies of the article have been coded, fill in a few more general details about the article

We will only code __preregistered__ studies (assuming that an article can contain preregistered and non-preregistered studies, e.g. a pilot study) and __confirmatory__ hypotheses (exploratory hypotheses/analyses are counted, but not coded in detail). 

__*IMPORTANT:*__ Specific responses to some questions will lead to follow-up questions popping up. First: sometimes the follow-up is initially displayed and then disappears when it's not needed - a harmless bug I didn't know how to fix. A more severe bug is when there are follow-up questions to a specific response to a follow-up question to a specific response to a regular question. __If you change your mind too often on the first question, it can lead to some of the pop-up questions malfunctioning/disappearing. Please just try to not click around too much and give precise responses the first time around.__

Please keep notes of any bugs you observe, as well as badly phrased questions, missing answer options, etc. We can fix the form very quickly if needed.

Welcome to the coding sheet! This form has a nested structure that follows the presumed structure of an article: An __article__ can contain one or several __studies__, each study can contain one or several __hypotheses__, and each hypothesis can be tested with one or several analyses, meaning that there can be one or several __results__ that relate to each hypothesis. How the form works:

* __Page 1__ (this one): general information about the article
* __Page 2__ (*study* page): specify the first study to be coded in this article
* __Page 3__ (*hypothesis* page): specify the first hypothesis to be coded in this study
* __Page 4__ (*results* page): fill in information about the first result relating to this hypothesis
* If there is another result for this hypothesis, you will loop back and repeat the *results* page
* __Page 5__ (*conclusions* page): when all results for one hypothesis have been coded, code the conclusions for the hypothesis
* If there is another hypothesis to code for this study, you will loop back to the *hypothesis* page
* When all hypotheses for one study have been coded and there is another study to code for this article, you will loop back to the *study* page
* __Page 6__ (final page): When all studies of the article have been coded, fill in a few more general details about the article

We will only code __preregistered__ studies (assuming that an article can contain preregistered and non-preregistered studies, e.g. a pilot study) and __confirmatory__ hypotheses (exploratory hypotheses/analyses are counted, but not coded in detail). 

__*IMPORTANT:*__ Specific responses to some questions will lead to follow-up questions popping up. First: sometimes the follow-up is initially displayed and then disappears when it's not needed - a harmless bug I didn't know how to fix. A more severe bug is when there are follow-up questions to a specific response to a follow-up question to a specific response to a regular question. __If you change your mind too often on the first question, it can lead to some of the pop-up questions malfunctioning/disappearing. Please just try to not click around too much and give precise responses the first time around.__

Please keep notes of any bugs you observe, as well as badly phrased questions, missing answer options, etc. We can fix the form very quickly if needed.

To confirm this, we conducted a pre-registered replication of Study 2 via the Open Science Framework (https://osf.io/zjevk/) for two reasons. First, we acknowledge the need for increased reproducibility in psychology research (Open Science Collaboration, 2015). This may be especially important when existing evidence relies on p-values very near the criterion for significance (Simonsohn, Nelson, & Simmons, 2014), as in our Study 2. Second, we wanted to improve the methodology of Study 2 by doubling the number of target faces seen by each participant (see Westfall, Judd, & Kenny, 2015, for a convincing argument advocating the need to increase stimulus sample size) and by cropping all of the faces to (a) exclude the neck and shoulders, and (b) eliminate excess hair. The latter ensured that participants inferred trustworthiness and dominance based on the faces versus extrafacial features.","2018-08-20 11:38:27",601162,1,11,0,"0000-0002-6627-0746",1,1,1,NA,"PR"

Welcome to the coding sheet! This form has a nested structure that follows the presumed structure of an article: An __article__ can contain one or several __studies__, each study can contain one or several __hypotheses__, and each hypothesis can be tested with one or several analyses, meaning that there can be one or several __results__ that relate to each hypothesis. How the form works:

* __Page 1__ (this one): general information about the article
* __Page 2__ (*study* page): specify the first study to be coded in this article
* __Page 3__ (*hypothesis* page): specify the first hypothesis to be coded in this study
* __Page 4__ (*results* page): fill in information about the first result relating to this hypothesis
* If there is another result for this hypothesis, you will loop back and repeat the *results* page
* __Page 5__ (*conclusions* page): when all results for one hypothesis have been coded, code the conclusions for the hypothesis
* If there is another hypothesis to code for this study, you will loop back to the *hypothesis* page
* When all hypotheses for one study have been coded and there is another study to code for this article, you will loop back to the *study* page
* __Page 6__ (final page): When all studies of the article have been coded, fill in a few more general details about the article

We will only code __preregistered__ studies (assuming that an article can contain preregistered and non-preregistered studies, e.g. a pilot study) and __confirmatory__ hypotheses (exploratory hypotheses/analyses are counted, but not coded in detail). 

__*IMPORTANT:*__ Specific responses to some questions will lead to follow-up questions popping up. First: sometimes the follow-up is initially displayed and then disappears when it's not needed - a harmless bug I didn't know how to fix. A more severe bug is when there are follow-up questions to a specific response to a follow-up question to a specific response to a regular question. __If you change your mind too often on the first question, it can lead to some of the pop-up questions malfunctioning/disappearing. Please just try to not click around too much and give precise responses the first time around.__

Please keep notes of any bugs you observe, as well as badly phrased questions, missing answer options, etc. We can fix the form very quickly if needed.

To confirm this, we conducted a pre-registered replication of Study 2 via the Open Science Framework (https://osf.io/zjevk/) for two reasons. First, we acknowledge the need for increased reproducibility in psychology research (Open Science Collaboration, 2015). This may be especially important when existing evidence relies on p-values very near the cri-terion for significance (Simonsohn, Nelson, & Simmons, 2014), as in ourStudy 2. Second, we wanted to improve the methodology of Study 2 by doubling the number of target faces seen by each participant (see Westfall, Judd, & Kenny, 2015, for a convincing argument advocatingthe need to increase stimulus sample size) and by cropping all of the faces to (a) exclude the neck and shoulders, and (b) eliminate excess hair. The latter ensured that participants inferred trustworthiness and dominance based on thefacesversus extrafacial features.","2018-08-07 09:16:13",325118.699999992,1,11,0,"Emma L Henderson ",1,1,1,NA,"PR"

Welcome to the coding sheet! This form has a nested structure that follows the presumed structure of an article: An __article__ can contain one or several __studies__, each study can contain one or several __hypotheses__, and each hypothesis can be tested with one or several analyses, meaning that there can be one or several __results__ that relate to each hypothesis. How the form works:

* __Page 1__ (this one): general information about the article
* __Page 2__ (*study* page): specify the first study to be coded in this article
* __Page 3__ (*hypothesis* page): specify the first hypothesis to be coded in this study
* __Page 4__ (*results* page): fill in information about the first result relating to this hypothesis
* If there is another result for this hypothesis, you will loop back and repeat the *results* page
* __Page 5__ (*conclusions* page): when all results for one hypothesis have been coded, code the conclusions for the hypothesis
* If there is another hypothesis to code for this study, you will loop back to the *hypothesis* page
* When all hypotheses for one study have been coded and there is another study to code for this article, you will loop back to the *study* page
* __Page 6__ (final page): When all studies of the article have been coded, fill in a few more general details about the article

We will only code __preregistered__ studies (assuming that an article can contain preregistered and non-preregistered studies, e.g. a pilot study) and __confirmatory__ hypotheses (exploratory hypotheses/analyses are counted, but not coded in detail). 

__*IMPORTANT:*__ Specific responses to some questions will lead to follow-up questions popping up. First: sometimes the follow-up is initially displayed and then disappears when it's not needed - a harmless bug I didn't know how to fix. A more severe bug is when there are follow-up questions to a specific response to a follow-up question to a specific response to a regular question. __If you change your mind too often on the first question, it can lead to some of the pop-up questions malfunctioning/disappearing. Please just try to not click around too much and give precise responses the first time around.__

Please keep notes of any bugs you observe, as well as badly phrased questions, missing answer options, etc. We can fix the form very quickly if needed.

type of memory representation. Relative to familiaritybased
memories, recollection-based memories were
more prone to decay than to interference. Likewise,relative to recollection-based memories, familiarity-based
memories were more prone to interference than to decay.
The pattern was the same for the other analysis: Relative
to low-confidence memories, high-confidence memories
were more prone to decay than to interference, and relative
to high-confidence memories, low-confidence memories
were more prone to interference than to decay. This
pattern of results is all the more telling because, to date,
most experimental manipulations (e.g., levels of processing,
attention) have been found to exert their effects
more strongly on recollection-based memories or
high-confidence memories than on familiarity-based
memories or low-confidence memories (Yonelinas, 2002).
Our results thus provide the first direct and clear evidence
for our representation theory of forgetting according

Welcome to the coding sheet! This form has a nested structure that follows the presumed structure of an article: An __article__ can contain one or several __studies__, each study can contain one or several __hypotheses__, and each hypothesis can be tested with one or several analyses, meaning that there can be one or several __results__ that relate to each hypothesis. How the form works:

* __Page 1__ (this one): general information about the article
* __Page 2__ (*study* page): specify the first study to be coded in this article
* __Page 3__ (*hypothesis* page): specify the first hypothesis to be coded in this study
* __Page 4__ (*results* page): fill in information about the first result relating to this hypothesis
* If there is another result for this hypothesis, you will loop back and repeat the *results* page
* __Page 5__ (*conclusions* page): when all results for one hypothesis have been coded, code the conclusions for the hypothesis
* If there is another hypothesis to code for this study, you will loop back to the *hypothesis* page
* When all hypotheses for one study have been coded and there is another study to code for this article, you will loop back to the *study* page
* __Page 6__ (final page): When all studies of the article have been coded, fill in a few more general details about the article

We will only code __preregistered__ studies (assuming that an article can contain preregistered and non-preregistered studies, e.g. a pilot study) and __confirmatory__ hypotheses (exploratory hypotheses/analyses are counted, but not coded in detail). 

__*IMPORTANT:*__ Specific responses to some questions will lead to follow-up questions popping up. First: sometimes the follow-up is initially displayed and then disappears when it's not needed - a harmless bug I didn't know how to fix. A more severe bug is when there are follow-up questions to a specific response to a follow-up question to a specific response to a regular question. __If you change your mind too often on the first question, it can lead to some of the pop-up questions malfunctioning/disappearing. Please just try to not click around too much and give precise responses the first time around.__

Please keep notes of any bugs you observe, as well as badly phrased questions, missing answer options, etc. We can fix the form very quickly if needed.

Welcome to the coding sheet! This form has a nested structure that follows the presumed structure of an article: An __article__ can contain one or several __studies__, each study can contain one or several __hypotheses__, and each hypothesis can be tested with one or several analyses, meaning that there can be one or several __results__ that relate to each hypothesis. How the form works:

* __Page 1__ (this one): general information about the article
* __Page 2__ (*study* page): specify the first study to be coded in this article
* __Page 3__ (*hypothesis* page): specify the first hypothesis to be coded in this study
* __Page 4__ (*results* page): fill in information about the first result relating to this hypothesis
* If there is another result for this hypothesis, you will loop back and repeat the *results* page
* __Page 5__ (*conclusions* page): when all results for one hypothesis have been coded, code the conclusions for the hypothesis
* If there is another hypothesis to code for this study, you will loop back to the *hypothesis* page
* When all hypotheses for one study have been coded and there is another study to code for this article, you will loop back to the *study* page
* __Page 6__ (final page): When all studies of the article have been coded, fill in a few more general details about the article

We will only code __preregistered__ studies (assuming that an article can contain preregistered and non-preregistered studies, e.g. a pilot study) and __confirmatory__ hypotheses (exploratory hypotheses/analyses are counted, but not coded in detail). 

__*IMPORTANT:*__ Specific responses to some questions will lead to follow-up questions popping up. First: sometimes the follow-up is initially displayed and then disappears when it's not needed - a harmless bug I didn't know how to fix. A more severe bug is when there are follow-up questions to a specific response to a follow-up question to a specific response to a regular question. __If you change your mind too often on the first question, it can lead to some of the pop-up questions malfunctioning/disappearing. Please just try to not click around too much and give precise responses the first time around.__

Please keep notes of any bugs you observe, as well as badly phrased questions, missing answer options, etc. We can fix the form very quickly if needed.

This form has a nested structure that follows the presumed structure of an article: An __article__ can contain one or several __studies__, each study can contain one or several __hypotheses__, and each hypothesis can be tested with one or several analyses, meaning that there can be one or several __results__ that relate to each hypothesis. How the form works:

* __Page 1__ (this one): general information about the article
* __Page 2__ (*study* page): specify the first study to be coded in this article
* __Page 3__ (*hypothesis* page): specify the first hypothesis to be coded in this study
* __Page 4__ (*results* page): fill in information about the first result relating to this hypothesis
* If there is another result for this hypothesis, you will loop back and repeat the *results* page
* __Page 5__ (*conclusions* page): when all results for one hypothesis have been coded, code the conclusions for the hypothesis
* If there is another hypothesis to code for this study, you will loop back to the *hypothesis* page
* When all hypotheses for one study have been coded and there is another study to code for this article, you will loop back to the *study* page
* __Page 6__ (final page): When all studies of the article have been coded, fill in a few more general details about the article

We will only code __preregistered__ studies (assuming that an article can contain preregistered and non-preregistered studies, e.g. a pilot study) and __confirmatory__ hypotheses (exploratory hypotheses/analyses are counted, but not coded in detail). 

__*IMPORTANT:*__ Specific responses to some questions will lead to follow-up questions popping up. First: sometimes the follow-up is initially displayed and then disappears when it's not needed - a harmless bug I didn't know how to fix. A more severe bug is when there are follow-up questions to a specific response to a follow-up question to a specific response to a regular question. __If you change your mind too often on the first question, it can lead to some of the pop-up questions malfunctioning/disappearing. Please just try to not click around too much and give precise responses the first time around.__

Please keep notes of any bugs you observe, as well as badly phrased questions, missing answer options, etc. We can fix the form very quickly if needed.

Welcome to the coding sheet! This form has a nested structure that follows the presumed structure of an article: An __article__ can contain one or several __studies__, each study can contain one or several __hypotheses__, and each hypothesis can be tested with one or several analyses, meaning that there can be one or several __results__ that relate to each hypothesis. How the form works:

* __Page 1__ (this one): general information about the article
* __Page 2__ (*study* page): specify the first study to be coded in this article
* __Page 3__ (*hypothesis* page): specify the first hypothesis to be coded in this study
* __Page 4__ (*results* page): fill in information about the first result relating to this hypothesis
* If there is another result for this hypothesis, you will loop back and repeat the *results* page
* __Page 5__ (*conclusions* page): when all results for one hypothesis have been coded, code the conclusions for the hypothesis
* If there is another hypothesis to code for this study, you will loop back to the *hypothesis* page
* When all hypotheses for one study have been coded and there is another study to code for this article, you will loop back to the *study* page
* __Page 6__ (final page): When all studies of the article have been coded, fill in a few more general details about the article

We will only code __preregistered__ studies (assuming that an article can contain preregistered and non-preregistered studies, e.g. a pilot study) and __confirmatory__ hypotheses (exploratory hypotheses/analyses are counted, but not coded in detail). 

__*IMPORTANT:*__ Specific responses to some questions will lead to follow-up questions popping up. First: sometimes the follow-up is initially displayed and then disappears when it's not needed - a harmless bug I didn't know how to fix. A more severe bug is when there are follow-up questions to a specific response to a follow-up question to a specific response to a regular question. __If you change your mind too often on the first question, it can lead to some of the pop-up questions malfunctioning/disappearing. Please just try to not click around too much and give precise responses the first time around.__

Please keep notes of any bugs you observe, as well as badly phrased questions, missing answer options, etc. We can fix the form very quickly if needed.

Welcome to the coding sheet! This form has a nested structure that follows the presumed structure of an article: An __article__ can contain one or several __studies__, each study can contain one or several __hypotheses__, and each hypothesis can be tested with one or several analyses, meaning that there can be one or several __results__ that relate to each hypothesis. How the form works:

* __Page 1__ (this one): general information about the article
* __Page 2__ (*study* page): specify the first study to be coded in this article
* __Page 3__ (*hypothesis* page): specify the first hypothesis to be coded in this study
* __Page 4__ (*results* page): fill in information about the first result relating to this hypothesis
* If there is another result for this hypothesis, you will loop back and repeat the *results* page
* __Page 5__ (*conclusions* page): when all results for one hypothesis have been coded, code the conclusions for the hypothesis
* If there is another hypothesis to code for this study, you will loop back to the *hypothesis* page
* When all hypotheses for one study have been coded and there is another study to code for this article, you will loop back to the *study* page
* __Page 6__ (final page): When all studies of the article have been coded, fill in a few more general details about the article

We will only code __preregistered__ studies (assuming that an article can contain preregistered and non-preregistered studies, e.g. a pilot study) and __confirmatory__ hypotheses (exploratory hypotheses/analyses are counted, but not coded in detail). 

__*IMPORTANT:*__ Specific responses to some questions will lead to follow-up questions popping up. First: sometimes the follow-up is initially displayed and then disappears when it's not needed - a harmless bug I didn't know how to fix. A more severe bug is when there are follow-up questions to a specific response to a follow-up question to a specific response to a regular question. __If you change your mind too often on the first question, it can lead to some of the pop-up questions malfunctioning/disappearing. Please just try to not click around too much and give precise responses the first time around.__

Please keep notes of any bugs you observe, as well as badly phrased questions, missing answer options, etc. We can fix the form very quickly if needed.

For individual points, adding MSCEIT scores yielded a significant partner effect of employees’ MSCEIT on recruiters’ points (Beta = 0.23, p < .05). This path was already marginally significant in the MSCEIT only model (Beta = 0.32, p < .06; see Table 4 ), suggesting that the effects of the MSCEIT and GERT are independent and complementary, rather than incremental: Recruiters’ gains were predicted by employees’ MSCEIT scores, whereas employees’ gains were predicted by recruiters’ GERT scores.

Welcome to the coding sheet! This form has a nested structure that follows the presumed structure of an article: An __article__ can contain one or several __studies__, each study can contain one or several __hypotheses__, and each hypothesis can be tested with one or several analyses, meaning that there can be one or several __results__ that relate to each hypothesis. How the form works:

* __Page 1__ (this one): general information about the article
* __Page 2__ (*study* page): specify the first study to be coded in this article
* __Page 3__ (*hypothesis* page): specify the first hypothesis to be coded in this study
* __Page 4__ (*results* page): fill in information about the first result relating to this hypothesis
* If there is another result for this hypothesis, you will loop back and repeat the *results* page
* __Page 5__ (*conclusions* page): when all results for one hypothesis have been coded, code the conclusions for the hypothesis
* If there is another hypothesis to code for this study, you will loop back to the *hypothesis* page
* When all hypotheses for one study have been coded and there is another study to code for this article, you will loop back to the *study* page
* __Page 6__ (final page): When all studies of the article have been coded, fill in a few more general details about the article

We will only code __preregistered__ studies (assuming that an article can contain preregistered and non-preregistered studies, e.g. a pilot study) and __confirmatory__ hypotheses (exploratory hypotheses/analyses are counted, but not coded in detail). 

__*IMPORTANT:*__ Specific responses to some questions will lead to follow-up questions popping up. First: sometimes the follow-up is initially displayed and then disappears when it's not needed - a harmless bug I didn't know how to fix. A more severe bug is when there are follow-up questions to a specific response to a follow-up question to a specific response to a regular question. __If you change your mind too often on the first question, it can lead to some of the pop-up questions malfunctioning/disappearing. Please just try to not click around too much and give precise responses the first time around.__

Please keep notes of any bugs you observe, as well as badly phrased questions, missing answer options, etc. We can fix the form very quickly if needed.

Welcome to the coding sheet! This form has a nested structure that follows the presumed structure of an article: An __article__ can contain one or several __studies__, each study can contain one or several __hypotheses__, and each hypothesis can be tested with one or several analyses, meaning that there can be one or several __results__ that relate to each hypothesis. How the form works:

* __Page 1__ (this one): general information about the article
* __Page 2__ (*study* page): specify the first study to be coded in this article
* __Page 3__ (*hypothesis* page): specify the first hypothesis to be coded in this study
* __Page 4__ (*results* page): fill in information about the first result relating to this hypothesis
* If there is another result for this hypothesis, you will loop back and repeat the *results* page
* __Page 5__ (*conclusions* page): when all results for one hypothesis have been coded, code the conclusions for the hypothesis
* If there is another hypothesis to code for this study, you will loop back to the *hypothesis* page
* When all hypotheses for one study have been coded and there is another study to code for this article, you will loop back to the *study* page
* __Page 6__ (final page): When all studies of the article have been coded, fill in a few more general details about the article

We will only code __preregistered__ studies (assuming that an article can contain preregistered and non-preregistered studies, e.g. a pilot study) and __confirmatory__ hypotheses (exploratory hypotheses/analyses are counted, but not coded in detail). 

__*IMPORTANT:*__ Specific responses to some questions will lead to follow-up questions popping up. First: sometimes the follow-up is initially displayed and then disappears when it's not needed - a harmless bug I didn't know how to fix. A more severe bug is when there are follow-up questions to a specific response to a follow-up question to a specific response to a regular question. __If you change your mind too often on the first question, it can lead to some of the pop-up questions malfunctioning/disappearing. Please just try to not click around too much and give precise responses the first time around.__

Overall, this partial support of Hypothesis 2 lends  credence to the validity of the scenario as a whole. ","2018-08-08 14:24:16",56796.0000000894,1,1,0,"Emma L Henderson ",2,1,2,NA,"RR"

Welcome to the coding sheet! This form has a nested structure that follows the presumed structure of an article: An __article__ can contain one or several __studies__, each study can contain one or several __hypotheses__, and each hypothesis can be tested with one or several analyses, meaning that there can be one or several __results__ that relate to each hypothesis. How the form works:

* __Page 1__ (this one): general information about the article
* __Page 2__ (*study* page): specify the first study to be coded in this article
* __Page 3__ (*hypothesis* page): specify the first hypothesis to be coded in this study
* __Page 4__ (*results* page): fill in information about the first result relating to this hypothesis
* If there is another result for this hypothesis, you will loop back and repeat the *results* page
* __Page 5__ (*conclusions* page): when all results for one hypothesis have been coded, code the conclusions for the hypothesis
* If there is another hypothesis to code for this study, you will loop back to the *hypothesis* page
* When all hypotheses for one study have been coded and there is another study to code for this article, you will loop back to the *study* page
* __Page 6__ (final page): When all studies of the article have been coded, fill in a few more general details about the article

We will only code __preregistered__ studies (assuming that an article can contain preregistered and non-preregistered studies, e.g. a pilot study) and __confirmatory__ hypotheses (exploratory hypotheses/analyses are counted, but not coded in detail). 

__*IMPORTANT:*__ Specific responses to some questions will lead to follow-up questions popping up. First: sometimes the follow-up is initially displayed and then disappears when it's not needed - a harmless bug I didn't know how to fix. A more severe bug is when there are follow-up questions to a specific response to a follow-up question to a specific response to a regular question. __If you change your mind too often on the first question, it can lead to some of the pop-up questions malfunctioning/disappearing. Please just try to not click around too much and give precise responses the first time around.__

Please keep notes of any bugs you observe, as well as badly phrased questions, missing answer options, etc. We can fix the form very quickly if needed.

Welcome to the coding sheet! This form has a nested structure that follows the presumed structure of an article: An __article__ can contain one or several __studies__, each study can contain one or several __hypotheses__, and each hypothesis can be tested with one or several analyses, meaning that there can be one or several __results__ that relate to each hypothesis. How the form works:

* __Page 1__ (this one): general information about the article
* __Page 2__ (*study* page): specify the first study to be coded in this article
* __Page 3__ (*hypothesis* page): specify the first hypothesis to be coded in this study
* __Page 4__ (*results* page): fill in information about the first result relating to this hypothesis
* If there is another result for this hypothesis, you will loop back and repeat the *results* page
* __Page 5__ (*conclusions* page): when all results for one hypothesis have been coded, code the conclusions for the hypothesis
* If there is another hypothesis to code for this study, you will loop back to the *hypothesis* page
* When all hypotheses for one study have been coded and there is another study to code for this article, you will loop back to the *study* page
* __Page 6__ (final page): When all studies of the article have been coded, fill in a few more general details about the article

We will only code __preregistered__ studies (assuming that an article can contain preregistered and non-preregistered studies, e.g. a pilot study) and __confirmatory__ hypotheses (exploratory hypotheses/analyses are counted, but not coded in detail). 

__*IMPORTANT:*__ Specific responses to some questions will lead to follow-up questions popping up. First: sometimes the follow-up is initially displayed and then disappears when it's not needed - a harmless bug I didn't know how to fix. A more severe bug is when there are follow-up questions to a specific response to a follow-up question to a specific response to a regular question. __If you change your mind too often on the first question, it can lead to some of the pop-up questions malfunctioning/disappearing. Please just try to not click around too much and give precise responses the first time around.__

Please keep notes of any bugs you observe, as well as badly phrased questions, missing answer options, etc. We can fix the form very quickly if needed.
